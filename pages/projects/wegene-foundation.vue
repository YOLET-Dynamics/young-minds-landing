            For 24 years, Wegene Ethiopian Foundation has made significant
            strides in supporting the Ethiopian community. Particularly the
            educational opportunities created for students strikes the interest
            in this collaboration. Young Minds collaborated with Wegene to
            enhance these efforts by sharing responsibilities.

            The goal is to spread equity through education. The youth is the
            next generation that will govern the way of life and it is our
            responsibility to ensure that knowledge of the highest quality is
            instilled in them. In the long run, the impact made today will be
            reflected in the growth of our economy, infrastructural expansion,
            and accessibility of basic needs. We collaborated to be part of our
            story as well, the story of the future.
